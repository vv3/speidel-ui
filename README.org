A simple web app to administer beer recipes on the Braumeister Speidel
brewing machine.

Recipes can be uploaded to the Speidel via 3 mechanisms:

- registering recipe data directly in the web page
- dropping a BeerXML-file from your local computer to the web page
- searching and downloading your personal recipes from
  https://brewersfriend.com/ (requires access to API, see below)
